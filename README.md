# python-challenge-1

# I went back through my lessons - many many MANY times
# I also used chatGPT to work through a couple of things I did not understand
# how do I make the spaces look correct.  It gave me something that works but 
# not perfect, this is mainly becuase I think you want me to develop 
# code lik the earlier version but I just could not get that to work!  I will 
# try more practice
